# tsv2pdm
A simple Python module for generating and processing python data structures from tsv files.
Unlike the [standard python csv module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html), it uses simple, lighweight data structures to represent tables and has built in functionality for sorting and comparing tables. tsv2pdm only supports tab separation - so the csv mod is a better bet if you need to read/write a variety of csv type file structures.
